# TripSlip Monorepo

A multi-app platform for managing school field trips. Includes digital permission slips, Stripe payments, and real-time parent communication.

## Architecture

Monorepo using npm workspaces + Turborepo with 5 Vite/React apps and shared packages, served through a reverse proxy on port 5000.

### Apps (all served through proxy on port 5000)
- `/` — Landing page (internal port 3000)
- `/venue/` — Venue management portal (internal port 3001)
- `/teacher/` — Teacher portal (internal port 3002)
- `/parent/` — Parent portal (internal port 3003)
- `/school/` — School admin portal (internal port 4200)

### Packages
- `packages/auth` — Supabase auth helpers
- `packages/database` — Supabase DB client and types
- `packages/i18n` — Internationalization
- `packages/ui` — Shared component library
- `packages/utils` — Shared utilities

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Vite + React 19
- **Routing**: React Router 7
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with neo-brutalist design system
- **Auth/DB**: Supabase
- **Payments**: Stripe
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo + npm workspaces
- **Runtime**: Node.js 20

## Design System (Neo-Brutalist)
- **Colors**: 60% White / 20% Black (#0A0A0A) / 20% Yellow (#F5C518)
- **Fonts**: Fraunces (display headings, `font-display`), Plus Jakarta Sans (body, `font-sans`), Space Mono (labels, `font-mono`)
- **Hover**: Cards/buttons lift UP (`translate(-4px,-4px)`) with shadow GROWING to 8px. NEVER shrink shadow on hover.
- **Shadows**: Default `shadow-offset` (4px), hover `shadow-offset-lg` (8px), active = 2px
- **Icons**: 3D glossy clay render PNGs (256x256, transparent BG) in each app's `public/images/icon-*.png`. 16 icons: backpack, bus, calendar, compass, graduation, language, magic, megaphone, payment, pencil, permission, shield, team, tracking, trophy, venue. Used standalone as `<img>` tags with `drop-shadow-[0_4px_8px_rgba(0,0,0,0.25)]`. No wrapper containers — icons float freely. Standard sizes: w-8 (xs), w-10 (sm), w-14 (md), w-20 (lg), w-24 (xl), w-32 (2xl).
- **Borders**: 2px bold borders, `border-3` available for emphasis
- **All app Tailwind configs** scan `packages/auth/src/` and `packages/ui/src/` and include `borderWidth: { '3': '3px' }`
- **Characters**: Buddy (blue, Planner), Gem (purple, Organizer), Scout (green, Navigator), Sparkle (pink, Explorer), Sunny (yellow, Leader), Dash (red, Adventurer)

## Running the Project

### Development
The workflow runs `bash start-dev.sh` which:
1. Starts all 5 Vite dev servers via `turbo dev`
2. Starts a reverse proxy (`proxy-server.mjs`) on port 5000

### Production / Deployment
Deployment uses autoscale target:
- **Build**: Runs `vite build` for each of the 5 apps (landing, venue, teacher, parent, school), producing `dist/` directories
- **Run**: `NODE_ENV=production node proxy-server.mjs` — serves all 5 built apps as static files via the same proxy server (no Vite dev servers needed)
- The proxy-server.mjs detects `NODE_ENV=production` or `REPL_DEPLOYMENT=1` and switches from proxying to dev servers to serving static files from `apps/*/dist/`
- All `VITE_*` env vars are baked into the JS bundle at build time
- Server-side secrets (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY`) are read at runtime from environment
- Twilio credentials are fetched from the Replit connector at runtime

The landing page at `/` has an `/apps` hub page that links to all other portals.

### Teacher App Pages
- `/` `/dashboard` — Dashboard with stats, quick actions, upcoming trips
- `/trips` — Full trip list with filters (upcoming/past/all), status badges
- `/trips/create` — Trip creation wizard (4 steps: details+transportation, experience, students, review+forms+funding+addons)
- `/trips/:tripId/roster` — Per-trip student roster with permission slip status + prominent shareable link (copy link / copy-with-message for parents)
- `/trips/:tripId/slips` — Permission slip tracking with send/remind/communication modal
- `/trips/:tripId/manifest` — Interactive attendance & manifest page with multi-point head counts (departure/arrival/return), real-time check-off, attendance history, CSV download, print-ready view. Uses existing `attendance` table with `notes` column storing JSON check data.
- `/students` — Full student management page (add, CSV import with parent info, edit, delete, send permission slip links)
- `/profile` — Teacher profile editing + password change
- `/venues/search` — Live Geoapify-powered venue discovery (enter address, finds nearby museums/zoos/etc)
- `/venues/:venueId` — Venue detail

### Key Files
- `proxy-server.mjs` — Reverse proxy + API routes (SMS, email, permission slips, file upload, venue discovery)
- `services/venue-discovery.mjs` — Geoapify-powered venue discovery service (geocoding, POI search, dedup, ranking, DB storage)
- `start-dev.sh` — Startup script for turbo + proxy
- `apps/teacher/src/components/roster/SendLinksModal.tsx` — Generate ONE link per trip for all parents (copy, SMS, Remind/ClassDojo)
- `apps/teacher/src/components/roster/CSVImportModal.tsx` — CSV import with parent contact info columns
- `apps/teacher/src/components/roster/AddStudentModal.tsx` — Add student with parent info
- `apps/parent/src/pages/TripLookupPage.tsx` — Self-service permission slip: parent opens trip link (`/parent/trip/:token`), fills in child info + contact + signature, creates slip in DB with form_data JSONB
- `apps/parent/src/pages/PermissionSlipSuccessPage.tsx` — Success page with optional account creation
- `apps/teacher/src/pages/TripManifestPage.tsx` — Interactive attendance page: multi-point head counts (departure/arrival/return tabs), checkbox check-off per student, "Mark All Present", missing student alerts, attendance history log, CSV export with attendance columns, print view with all 3 check columns

### Routing
Each sub-app uses a `basename` on its `BrowserRouter` (e.g., `/venue`, `/teacher`) and a matching `base` in its Vite config. The proxy forwards requests by path prefix to the correct internal Vite dev server.

## Environment Variables

Required env vars (see `.env.example`):
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — Supabase project URL (env var)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase anonymous key (env var)
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Supabase service role key (secret)
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — Stripe publishable key (env var)
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` — Stripe secret key (secret)
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` — Twilio account SID (secret)
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` — Twilio auth token (secret)
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` — Twilio phone number (secret)
- `CUSTOMERIO_API_KEY` — Customer.io API key (secret)

## Replit Migration Notes
- All vite configs bind `host: '0.0.0.0'` and `allowedHosts: true`
- Reverse proxy on port 5000 routes to all apps by path prefix
- Each app has `base` set in vite config and `basename` on BrowserRouter
- Node.js upgraded from 18 to 20
- Vercel/Netlify config files removed
- `packages/database` updated to use `import.meta.env` with `process.env` fallback

## Supabase Auth Isolation
Since all apps run on the same domain, each app uses a unique `storageKey` for its Supabase client to prevent GoTrueClient lock conflicts:
- Teacher: `sb-tripslip-teacher-auth` (in `apps/teacher/src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- Venue: `sb-tripslip-venue-auth` (in `apps/venue/src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- Parent: `sb-tripslip-parent-auth` (in `apps/parent/src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- School: `sb-tripslip-school-auth` (in `apps/school/src/lib/supabase.ts`)
- Landing: `sb-tripslip-landing-auth` (in `apps/landing/src/lib/supabase.ts`)

The default `supabase` export from `@tripslip/database` is lazy-initialized (via Proxy) to prevent duplicate GoTrueClient instances during HMR. The `@tripslip/auth` shared package exposes `supabaseClient` through the auth context so child components don't need to create new clients.

**Important**: The `onAuthStateChange` callback in `packages/auth/src/context.tsx` defers database queries via `setTimeout(fn, 0)` to avoid deadlocking with Supabase GoTrueClient's internal Web Lock (which is held during `signInWithPassword`). Do NOT make `supabase.from()` calls directly inside `onAuthStateChange`.

## Supabase RLS & Signup

Migration `supabase/migrations/20250304000001_fix_rbac_signup_policies.sql` must be applied to Supabase. It adds:
- `assign_user_role()` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER) for role assignment during signup
- `create_teacher_on_signup()` RPC (SECURITY DEFINER) for creating teacher records
- `list_schools_for_signup()` RPC for school selector (public access)

**IMPORTANT**: The `assign_user_role()` RPC allows `teacher`, `parent`, `venue_admin`, `school_admin`, and `district_admin` self-assignment. It enforces `auth.uid()` so users can only assign roles to themselves. The `tripslip_admin` role cannot be self-assigned. Migration `20250308000001_fix_school_admin_signup.sql` added the admin roles and uid check.

**Supabase DB connection**: Use session pooler at `aws-1-us-east-2.pooler.supabase.com:5432` with user `postgres.yvzpgbhinxibebgeevcu` and `SUPABASE_DB_PASSWORD` secret. Transaction pooler (port 6543) does NOT work for DDL.
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies on `active_role_context` (user self-management)
- Public read policy on `schools` table for signup form
- `is_active` column and unique `user_id` index on `teachers` table

The signup flow uses RPC functions instead of direct table inserts to bypass RLS safely.

## Database Seeding

Three seed scripts, run in order:

1. **`node scripts/seed-demo-data.mjs`** — Base data: 6 venues, 12 experiences, 15 pricing tiers, 1 school, 15 students
2. **`node scripts/seed-demo-scenarios.mjs`** — Core scenarios: 3 schools, 4 teachers, 6 rosters, 100+ students, 11 trips, 4 parents, 2 venue admin links, venue bookings
3. **`node scripts/seed-expanded-demos.mjs`** — Expanded variety: 6 more parents (multi-language), parent-student links, 8 more trips (free, cancelled, split-funded, big assistance funds), 139+ more permission slips across all statuses, 88+ payment records, 7 more venue bookings

Final totals: 4 schools, 8 teachers, 9 rosters, 185 students, 22 trips (all statuses), 251 permission slips, 88 payments, 76 parent-student links, 12 venue bookings, 10 parent accounts.

4. **`node scripts/seed-ja-financial-district.mjs`** — JA Finance Park Detroit demo: 1 venue (JA Finance Park, 1 Kennedy Square, Detroit Financial District), 4 experiences, 10 pricing tiers, 3 venue team members, 6 Detroit DPSCD schools (Cass Tech, DPSCD Virtual, Southeastern, Renaissance, Henry Ford Academy, Marygrove/CMA), 6 teachers, students with rosters, 7 trips, 7 venue bookings, permission slips, payments. Login: sarah.mitchell@jadetroit.org / TripSlip2026!

All scripts use `upsert`/existence checks and are idempotent.

## Real Database Integration

The teacher app queries **real Supabase data** (no mock fallbacks):
- **Dashboard**: Queries `trips` joined with `experiences` and `venues` for the logged-in teacher. Shows empty welcome state if no trips exist.
- **Step 2 (Experiences)**: Queries `experiences` joined with `venues` and `pricing_tiers`. Shows venue name, duration, grade levels, and pricing.
- **Step 3 (Students)**: Queries `students` via the teacher's `rosters`. Falls back to all students (scoped to authenticated user) if no roster found.
- **Step 4 (Review/Submit)**: Fetches `pricing_tiers` for cost calculation, `venues` for location display. Creates real trip record in DB.

Trip creation drafts are stored in **localStorage** (not the `trip_drafts` DB table, which doesn't exist). The `useAutoSave` hook saves drafts every 30 seconds via localStorage keyed by teacher ID.

The `ProtectedRoute` in the teacher app only requires `user` auth — it does not require a `teachers` table record, which allows demo login without DB seeding.

The `signIn` flow wraps role-loading in try/catch and falls back to a default `teacher` role if no `role_assignments` records exist.

## Permission Slip Flow
1. Teacher generates ONE link per trip via `trips.direct_link_token` (SendLinksModal)
2. Teacher shares link via SMS bulk send, copy-with-message, or Remind/ClassDojo
3. Parent opens `/parent/trip/{token}` → TripLookupPage shows full form
4. Parent fills in: child name/grade/allergies, parent contact, emergency contact, signature
5. On submit: creates `permission_slips` record with `student_id = NULL`, data in `form_data` JSONB
6. Status: `signed` (payment is greyed out as "Coming Soon")
7. Redirects to PermissionSlipSuccessPage
8. Success page shows "Create Free Account" prompt (unless already logged in)
9. Teacher sees slip appear in real-time on PermissionSlipTrackingPage
10. Teacher views trip manifest for day-of attendance at `/trips/:tripId/manifest`

## Venue → Teacher → Parent Consent Flow (No Signup Required)
The JA Finance Park "Stock Market Challenge" flow demonstrates the consent/indemnification pipeline:
1. **Venue** (JA admin) goes to Experience Detail page → clicks "Send Consent Link to Teacher"
2. `SendTeacherLinkModal` collects teacher email + trip date → `POST /api/venue/send-teacher-link` creates trip + trip_form records with indemnification text
3. **Teacher** receives link `/teacher/trip/{token}/review` — NO login required (public route outside ProtectedRoute)
4. Teacher sees venue's indemnification form, can optionally add more requirements via `POST /api/trip/add-form`
5. Teacher clicks "Copy Parent Link" → gets `/parent/trip/{token}` URL to share with parents
6. **Parent** opens link — NO login required. Sees trip details, consent forms with checkboxes, fills in student/parent/emergency info
7. Parent signs and submits via `POST /api/trip/submit-consent` → permission_slips record created with all form_data
8. Both teacher (review page) and venue (ConsentTracker component) can see completion status

### Public Proxy Endpoints (no auth required, rate-limited)
- `POST /api/trip/lookup` — Fetch trip + forms + slips by `direct_link_token`
- `POST /api/trip/submit-consent` — Submit parent consent form (creates/updates permission_slip)
- `POST /api/trip/add-form` — Teacher adds additional requirement to trip
- `POST /api/trip/remove-form` — Teacher removes their added requirement

### Key Files for Consent Flow
- `apps/venue/src/components/SendTeacherLinkModal.tsx` — Venue sends link to teacher
- `apps/teacher/src/pages/TripConsentReviewPage.tsx` — Teacher reviews & forwards (no auth)
- `apps/parent/src/pages/TripLookupPage.tsx` — Parent fills out consent (no auth)
- `apps/venue/src/components/ConsentTracker.tsx` — Venue sees consent completion status

### Parent Account Flow (Optional Sign-Up)
- After completing a permission slip (free or paid), parent sees account creation prompt
- Two sign-up methods: email+password OR phone+OTP verification
- Sign-up links auth user to existing `parents` record via `user_id`
- If no parent record exists, creates one from slip `form_data`
- Logged-in parents see their dashboard at `/parent/dashboard`

### Parent App Routes
| Path | Page | Auth Required |
|---|---|---|
| `/` `/login` | ParentLoginPage | No |
| `/signup` | ParentSignupPage (email or phone) | No |
| `/dashboard` | ParentDashboardPage (trips, children, payments) | Yes |
| `/trip/:token` | TripLookupPage (guest slip filling) | No |
| `/slip/:slipId` | PermissionSlipPage | Token |
| `/permission-slip/success` | PermissionSlipSuccessPage | Token |
| `/payment` | PaymentPage | Token |
| `/payment/success` | PaymentSuccessPage | Token |

### Status Values for permission_slips
`pending` → `sent` → `signed` / `signed_pending_payment` → `paid` / `cancelled`

### localStorage
- `tripslip_parent_info` — Stores parent+child info for pre-filling on future trips

## Design System

TripSlip uses a neo-brutalist design language with premium 3D claymorphic visual elements:
- Primary yellow: `#F5C518`
- Primary black: `#0A0A0A`
- Card borders: `border-2 border-[#0A0A0A]`
- Drop shadows: `shadow-[4px_4px_0px_#0A0A0A]` (offset) / `shadow-[8px_8px_0px_#0A0A0A]` (offset-lg)
- Hover effect: `hover:shadow-[2px_2px_0px_#0A0A0A] hover:translate-x-[2px] hover:translate-y-[2px]`
- Accent background: `bg-[#FFFDE7]`
- Fonts: Fraunces (display), Plus Jakarta Sans (body), Space Mono (mono)
- Animations: float, bounce-slow, fade-in, slide-up (defined in tailwind.config.ts)

### Visual Assets (deployed to all apps in public/images/)
- **TripSlip Logo**: `tripslip-logo.png` (yellow ticket icon + "tripslip" wordmark, white background — used in all headers/navs), `tripslip-logo-dark.png` (black background variant), `tripslip-logo-large.png` (larger version for hero/splash contexts). All deployed to every app's `public/images/`.
- **Stock photos**: hero-fieldtrip, students-museum, science-lab, zoo-visit, teacher-leading, art-workshop (AI-generated field trip scenes)
- **3D Claymorphic icons**: icon-permission, icon-payment, icon-magic, icon-venue, icon-tracking, icon-language, icon-bus, icon-backpack, icon-compass, icon-calendar, icon-shield, icon-megaphone, icon-pencil, icon-trophy, icon-team, icon-graduation (transparent PNGs, used throughout all apps)
- **Claymation characters**: char-pink-heart, char-blue-square, char-green-octagon, char-purple-diamond, char-yellow-star, char-red-pill (individual animated mascots used in headers/sidebars)
- **Brand characters**: brand-characters.png (mascot crew)

### Landing Page Sections (HomePage.tsx)
Header → Hero (photo + live dashboard overlay) → PhotoShowcase (5-photo gallery) → HowItWorks (4 steps) → FeatureGrid (6 features with claymorphic icons) → BrandCharacters (mascot crew) → Testimonials → CTASection → Footer (dark)

## Navigation Structure

Navigation is defined in `packages/auth/src/components/Navigation.tsx`:
- **Teacher**: Dashboard, Trips, Venues, Students, Profile
- **School Admin**: Dashboard, Approvals, Teachers
- **District Admin**: Dashboard, District Overview
- **TripSlip Admin**: Dashboard, Admin Panel
- **Venue Admin**: Uses its own `VenueNavigation` component in `apps/venue/src/components/VenueNavigation.tsx` (Dashboard, Experiences, Bookings, Trips, Financials, Employees, Profile). Auth context loads venue data once via `useVenue()` hook — all hooks/pages use shared `venueId` instead of querying `venue_users` individually. Financials shows real payment/revenue data with filters and charts. Employees shows team members with role management and invite flow (via `/api/venue/lookup-user` proxy endpoint).

Active nav state uses `startsWith()` for sub-paths (except Dashboard which is exact match).

## Venue Discovery (Geoapify)

The venue search uses Geoapify Places API for live discovery. The `GEOAPIFY_API_KEY` env var is required.

### Correct Geoapify Categories (v2/places API)
- `entertainment.museum` — museums
- `entertainment.zoo` — zoos  
- `entertainment.aquarium` — aquariums
- `entertainment.planetarium` — planetariums
- `entertainment.culture.arts_centre` — arts/science centers
- `heritage` — historic sites
- `tourism.attraction` — general attractions
- `leisure.park.nature_reserve` — nature reserves
- `leisure.park.garden` — botanical gardens
- `national_park` — national parks
- `natural.protected_area` — protected areas
- `commercial.food_and_drink.farm` — farms

NOTE: Categories like `tourism.museum`, `tourism.zoo`, `tourism.aquarium` do NOT exist in the Geoapify API — they return 400 errors.

### Discovery + Growing Database
Every search ALWAYS runs both DB lookup AND Geoapify discovery in parallel. New venues not yet in our database get enriched with Wikipedia images/descriptions and stored automatically. The database grows with every teacher search — eventually becoming the primary source with ratings, reviews, and experiences that Geoapify doesn't have.

Response includes `db_count` (venues from our DB) and `new_discovered` (freshly found venues being stored). DB venues get priority in ranking (they have richer data, experiences, reviews). Discovered venues stored with: name, description (from Wikipedia or generated), address JSON with lat/lon, website, phone, primary_photo_url (Wikipedia or Unsplash stock by type), source='geoapify'.

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/discovery/search` — DB-cached Geoapify search: `{address, radiusMiles, venueTypes?, searchText?}` → checks DB first, falls back to Geoapify, enriches with Wikipedia, stores in DB, returns ranked results with photos/descriptions
- `POST /api/discovery/nearby` — Same as search but accepts lat/lon directly: `{lat, lon, radius_miles}`
- `POST /api/discovery/geocode` — Geocode only: `{address}` → `{lat, lon, formatted}`
- `POST /api/discovery/run` — Full pipeline for a school: `{school_id}` → discover + store in DB

## Critical DB Facts (for querying)

- `trips` has NO `title`, NO `school_id` — use experience title; filter by teacher_id
- `teachers` has `first_name` + `last_name`, NOT `name`; has `school_id`
- `venues.address` is JSON: `{city, state, street, zipCode}`
- FK patterns: trips → `experience:experiences(...)`, experiences → `venue:venues(...)`; NO direct trips→venues FK
- `venue_users` table (NOT `venue_employees`): columns are id, venue_id, user_id, role
- `pricing_tiers` has NO `tier_name`; belongs to experience via `experience_id`
- `experiences` has NO `pricing_per_student`
- Trip statuses: `draft`, `pending`, `pending_approval`, `approved`, `confirmed`, `rejected`, `cancelled`, `completed`
- Slip statuses: `pending` → `sent` → `signed` / `signed_pending_payment` → `paid` / `cancelled`

## HCD / UX Improvements

- **Global focus states**: All 5 apps have `focus-visible` ring styles using brand yellow `#F5C518`, `::selection` highlight, `prefers-reduced-motion` support. Defined in each app's `src/index.css` `@layer base`.
- **Parent login**: Redesigned to match teacher/venue login warmth (mascot, floating icons, rounded-xl inputs, trust signals).
- **Navigation**: `aria-current="page"` on active links, mobile menu auto-closes on route change.
- **Dashboard**: Staggered fade-in animations on stat cards and quick actions, new-user onboarding hint, improved empty state with CTA.
- **Trips page**: Status badges include icons, filter tabs show counts, filter-specific empty states, improved attendance button sizing.
- **Students page**: 44px min touch targets on edit/delete, brand-yellow hover row highlight, zebra striping, CSV import summary toast.
- **Permission slip**: Sticky progress bar (5 sections), "Secure form" trust badge, field-level green checkmarks on valid fields, improved signature area with "Clear & Redo" button and placeholder text.
